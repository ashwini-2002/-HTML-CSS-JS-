1. What is data and types of data 
In SQL, data refers to raw and unprocessed information that can be stored and manipulated within a database. 
                       *************************************************************************************
This information can include various attributes like names, classes, marks, and more. Essentially, data in SQL represents the fundamental building blocks of information that can be organized, queried, and managed within a database system.


->types of data

SQL Data Types
An SQL developer must be aware of what type of data will be stored inside each column while creating a table. The data type guideline for SQL is to understand what type of data is expected inside each column and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

For every database, data types are primarily classified into three categories.

1.Numeric Datatypes
*********************
2.Date and Time Database
*************************
3.String Database
******************



Like in other programming languages, SQL also has certain datatypes available. A brief idea of all the datatypes is discussed below.

Array Datatype
SQL Server does not have a built-in array datatype. However, it is possible to simulate arrays using tables or XML data types.

This text discusses the properties of data types in MYSQL.
SQL data types define the type of data that can be stored in a database column or variable. Here are the most common SQL data types:

Datatype

Properties

Numeric data types
*******************
These are used to store numeric values. Examples include INT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, and FLOAT.

Character data types
********************
These are used to store character strings. Examples include CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT.

Date and time data types
***********************
These are used to store date and time values. Examples include DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP

Binary data types
*****************
These are used to store binary data, such as images or audio files. Examples include BLOB and BYTEA.

Boolean data type
*****************
This data type is used to store logical values. The only possible values are TRUE and FALSE.

Interval data types
********************
These are used to store intervals of time. Examples include INTERVAL YEAR, INTERVAL MONTH, and INTERVAL DAY.

Spatial data types
******************
These are used to store geometric or geographic data. Examples include POINT, LINE, and POLYGON.

Different databases may have different variations of these data types, or they may have additional data types not listed here. Understanding SQL data types are important for creating tables and working with data in a database, as it affects how data is stored and processed.





2. What is Database

A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system. 
*****************************************************************************************                                                         
It can be managed through a Database Management System (DBMS), a software used to manage data. Database refers to related data in a structured form.
                            ********************************* 
Application:
 Company Information, Account information, manufacturing, banking, finance transactions, telecommunications.
************************************************************************************************************
In a database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns and it is indexed so data can be updated, expanded, and deleted easily. Computer databases typically contain file records data like transactions money in one bank account to another bank account, sales and customer details, fee details of students, and product details. There are different kinds of databases, ranging from the most prevalent approach, the relational database, to a distributed database, cloud database, and NoSQL databases.  

-> types of data base 
1.Relational Database: A relational database is made up of a set of tables with data that fits into a predefined category.
*********************
2.Distributed Database: A distributed database is a database in which portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations, and in which processing is dispersed or replicated 
***********************
among different points in a network. 
3.Cloud Database: A cloud database is a database that typically runs on a cloud computing platform. Database service provides access to the database. Database services make the underlying 
*****************
software stack transparent to the user.



3. Difference between DDL, DML and DCL in SQL

Short Overview on SQL
DDL (Data Definition Language)
DQL (Data Query Language)
DML(Data Manipulation Language)
DCL (Data Control Language)
TCL (Transaction Control Language


 *DDL commands are used to define and control the database. 
*DML is used to control and manipulate the data.
* DCL is used for security and access to the database.



DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.

List of DDL commands: 

CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.

DML(Data Manipulation Language)
The SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

List of DML commands: 

INSERT: It is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE: It is used to delete records from a database table.
LOCK: Table control concurrency.
CALL: Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram.
EXPLAIN PLAN: It describes the access path to data.

DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

List of  DCL commands: 

GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.

Syntax:

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE TO SOME_USER, ANOTHER_USER;  

REVOKE: This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

Syntax:

REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1, USER2;  











4)What is SQL?(sql is standard language for database creating and manupilation )y
SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a computer language that we use to interact with a relational database. SQL is a tool for organizing, managing, and retrieving archived data 
****************************************
from a computer database. The original name was given by IBM as Structured English Query Language, abbreviated by the acronym SEQUEL. When data needs to be retrieved from a database, SQL is used to make the request. The DBMS processes the SQL query retrieves the requested data and returns it to us. Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data should be organized or what data should be extracted or added to the database.

In common usage, SQL encompasses DDL and DML commands for CREATE, UPDATE, modified, or other operations on database structure.


What are the characteristics of SQL?
SQL may be utilized by quite a number of users, which include people with very little programming experience.
SQL is a non-procedural language. 
We can without difficulty create and replace databases in SQL. It isn’t a time-consuming process. 
SQL is primarily based totally on ANSI standards. 
SQL does now no longer have a continuation individual.
SQL is entered into the SQL buffer on one or more lines. 
SQL makes use of a termination individual to execute instructions immediately. It makes use of features to carry out a few formatting.
It uses functions to perform some formatting. 


Uses of SQL
Data definition: It is used to define the structure and organization of the stored data and the relationships among the stored data items.
Data retrieval: SQL can also be used for data retrieval.
Data manipulation: If the user wants to add new data, remove data, or modifying in existing data then SQL provides this facility also.
Access control: SQL can be used to restrict a user’s ability to retrieve, add, and modify data, protecting stored data against unauthorized access.
Data sharing: SQL is used to coordinate data sharing by concurrent users, ensuring that changes made by one user do not inadvertently wipe out changes made at nearly the same time by another user.
SQL also differs from other computer languages because it describes what the user wants the computer to do rather than how the computer should do it. (In more technical terms, SQL is a declarative or descriptive language rather than a procedural one.) SQL contains no IF statement for testing conditions, and no GOTO, DO, or FOR statements for program flow control. Rather, SQL statements describe how a collection of data is to be organized, or what data is to be retrieved or added to the database. The sequence of steps to do those tasks is left for the DBMS to determine.

SQL Rules
A ‘;’ is used to end SQL statements.
Statements may be split across lines, but keywords may not.
Identifiers, operator names, and literals are separated by one or more spaces or other delimiters.
A comma (,) separates parameters without a clause.
A space separates a clause.
Reserved words cannot be used as identifiers unless enclosed with double quotes.
Identifiers can contain up to 30 characters.
Identifiers must start with an alphabetic character.
Characters and date literals must be enclosed within single quotes.
Numeric literals can be represented by simple values.
Comments may be enclosed between /* and */ symbols and maybe multi-line.

Why SQL?
SQL is an interactive question language. Users type SQL instructions into an interactive SQL software to retrieve facts and show them on the screen, presenting a convenient, easy-to-use device for ad hoc database queries. 
SQL is a database programming language. Programmers embed SQL instructions into their utility packages to access the facts in a database. Both user-written packages and database software packages (consisting of document writers and facts access tools) use this approach for database access. 
SQL is a client/server language. Personal computer programs use SQL to communicate over a network with database servers that save shared facts. This client/server architecture is utilized by many famous enterprise-class applications.
 SQL is Internet facts access language. Internet net servers that interact with company facts and Internet utility servers all use SQL as a widespread language for getting access to company databases, frequently through embedding SQL databases get entry to inside famous scripting languages like PHP or Perl.
 SQL is a distributed database language. Distributed database control structures use SQL to assist distribute facts throughout many linked pc structures. The DBMS software program on every gadget makes use of SQL to speak with the opposite structures, sending requests for facts to get entry to. 
SQL is a database gateway language. In a pc community with a mixture of various DBMS products, SQL is frequently utilized in a gateway that lets one logo of DBMS speak with every other logo. SQL has for this reason emerged as a useful, effective device for linking people, pc packages, and pc structures to the facts saved in a relational database. 

What are SQL commands?
Developers use structured query language (SQL) commands, which are specific keywords or SQL statements, to work with data stored in relational databases. The following are categories for SQL commands.

poster
1. Data Definition Language
SQL commands used to create the database structure are known as data definition language (DDL). Based on the needs of the business, database engineers create and modify database objects using DDL. The CREATE command, for instance, is used by the database engineer to create database objects like tables, views, and indexes.
Command

1. CREATE

Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.

2. ALTER

Modifies an existing database object, such as a table

DROP

Deletes an entire table, a view of a table, or other objects in the database.

2. Data Manipulation Language 
A relational database can be updated with new data using data manipulation language (DML) statements. The INSERT command, for instance, is used by an application to add a new record to the database.
Command

1. SELECT

Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.

2. INSERT

Creates a record.

3. UPDATE

Modifies records.

4. DELETE

Deletes records.

3. Data Query Language
Data retrieval instructions are written in the data query language (DQL), which is used to access relational databases. The SELECT command is used by software programs to filter and return particular results from a SQL table. 
4. Data Control language
Data control language (DCL) is a programming language used by database administrators to control or grant other users access to databases. For instance, they can allow specific applications to manipulate one or more tables by using the GRANT command.
Command

1. GRANT

Gives a privilege to the user.

2. REVOKE

Takes back privileges granted by the user.

5. Transaction Control Language
To automatically update databases, the relational engine uses transaction control language (TCL). For instance, the database can reverse a mistaken transaction using the ROLLBACK command. 
SQL Injection
A cyberattack known as SQL injection involves tricking the database with SQL queries. To retrieve, alter, or corrupt data in a SQL database, hackers use SQL injection. To execute a SQL injection attack, for instance, they might enter a SQL query in place of a person’s name in a submission form.

What is SQL Server?
Microsoft’s relational database management system, which uses SQL to manipulate data, is formally known as SQL Server. There are various editions of the MS SQL Server, and each is tailored for particular workloads and requirements.

Finally, SQL is not a particularly structured language, especially when compared with highly structured languages such as C, Pascal, or Java. Instead, SQL statements resemble English sentences, complete with “noise words” that don’t add to the meaning of the statement but make it read more naturally. SQL has quite a few inconsistencies and also some special rules to prevent you from constructing SQL statements that look perfectly legal but that don’t make sense.

Despite the inaccuracy of its name, SQL has emerged as the standard language for using relational databases. SQL is both a powerful language and one that is relatively easy to learn. So, SQL is a database management language. The database administrator is answerable for handling a minicomputer or mainframe database and makes use of SQL to outline the database shape and manipulate get entry to the saved data.

How SQL Works?
A server machine is used in the implementation of the structured query language (SQL), processing database queries and returning results. The following are some of the software elements that the SQL process goes through.
